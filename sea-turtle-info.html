    <h2>SNAPPING TURTLE</h2>
    <p>The common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina) is a species of large freshwater turtle in the family Chelydridae. Its natural range extends from southeastern Canada, southwest to the edge of the Rocky Mountains, as far east as Nova Scotia and Florida. The present-day Chelydra serpentina population in the Middle Rio Grande suggests that the common snapping turtle has been present in this drainage since at least the seventeenth century and is likely native.<br>The common snapping turtle is noted for its combative disposition when out of the water with its powerful beak-like jaws, and highly mobile head and neck (hence the specific epithet serpentina, meaning "snake-like"). In water, it is likely to flee and hide underwater in sediment.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They can live up to a maximum age over 100 years</li>
      <li>The common snapping turtle uses its large claws for digging, not offense – though the claws can become dangerous when handled by humans.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>SPOTTED TURTLE</h2>
    <p>The spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata), the only species of the genus Clemmys, is a small, semi-aquatic turtle that reaches a carapace length of 8–12 cm (3.1–4.7 in)[4] upon adulthood. Their broad, smooth, low dark-colored upper shell, or carapace, ranges in its exact colour from black to a bluish black with a number of tiny yellow round spots. The spotting patterning extends from the head, to the neck and out onto the limbs.<br>Spotted turtles are aquatic omnivores that inhabit a variety of semi-aquatic or in other words, shallow, fresh-water areas such as flooded forests, marshes, wet meadows, bogs and woodland streams in southern Canada (Ontario) and the eastern US: the eastern Great Lakes and east of the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They can live up 65 to 110 years.</li>
      <li>Carapace is keelless and contains a varying number of yellow spots.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>EASTERN BOX TURTLE</h2>
    <p>The eastern box turtle (Terrapene carolina carolina) is a subspecies within a group of hinge-shelled turtles normally called box turtles. T. c. carolina is native to the Eastern United States.
The eastern box turtle is a subspecies of the common box turtle (Terrapene carolina). While in the pond turtle family, Emydidae, and not a tortoise, the box turtle is largely terrestrial.[4] Box turtles are slow crawlers, extremely long-lived, and slow to mature and have relatively few offspring per year. These characteristics, along with a propensity to get hit by cars and agricultural machinery, make all box turtle species particularly susceptible to anthropogenic, or human-induced, mortality.<br>In 2011, citing "a widespread persistent and ongoing gradual decline of Terrapene carolina that probably exceeds 32% over three generations", the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) downgraded its conservation status from near threatened to vulnerable.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They can live up to a maximum age over 100 years</li>
      <li>But in wilderness,they generally live for 25 to 35 years.</li>

    <h2>RED EARED Turtle</h2>
    <p>The red-eared slider or red-eared terrapin (Trachemys scripta elegans) is a subspecies of the pond slider (Trachemys scripta), a semiaquatic turtle belonging to the family Emydidae. It is the most popular pet turtle in the United States, is also popular as a pet across the rest of the world, and is the most invasive turtle. It is the most commonly traded turtle in the world.
The red-eared slider is native from the Midwestern United States to northern Mexico, but has become established in other places because of pet releases, and has become invasive in many areas where it outcompetes native species. The red-eared slider is included in the list of the world's 100 most invasive species.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They can live up to 20-30 years.</li>
      <li>In captivity,they can live over 40 years.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>MISSISSIPPI MAP TURTLE</h2>
    <p>he Mississippi map turtle (Graptemys pseudogeographica kohnii), also known commonly as Kohn's map turtle,[3] is a subspecies of land and water turtle belonging to the family Emydidae. G. p. kohnii is native to the central United States.The common name, Mississippi map turtle, derives not from the state of Mississippi, but rather from the Mississippi River.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They can live up to a maximum age of 30 years</li>
      <li>The gray carapace is covered in yellow lines which resemble contour lines of a map</li>

    <h2>EASTERN LONG-NECKED TURTLE</h2>
    <p>Named after its exceptionally long neck, this freshwater turtle is found in southeastern Australia. The head and neck, when extended, make up 60% of the turtle’s total length of 25 cm / 9.84 in.
The eastern long-necked turtle has a lifespan of up to 37 years. A carnivore, the turtle’s prey consists of fish, mollusks, crustaceans, tadpoles and other aquatic invertebrates. They will also occasionally catch terrestrial insects.
The species has a peculiar defense mechanism: when threatened by a predator, it will emit a foul smelling yellow fluid from its musk glands. It is also known to retract its head into its shell and charge a potential predator, sometimes while also snapping its jaws defensively.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Scientific name: Chelodina longicollis
Suborder: Pleurodira (side-necked turtles)
</li>
      <li>Where found: Australia</li>

It inhabits dry shrublands in California, Nevada, Utah and Arizona.Desert tortoises are herbivorous. They spend 95 - 98 % of their life underground.They are equipped with long claws that make them efficient diggers.The main threats to this critically endangered species are habitat loss and habitat fragmentation, both caused by to human activity.</p>

    <h2>SOFTSHELL TURTLE</h2>
    <p>The Florida softshell turtle is the largest member of the softshell turtle family, Trionychidae, found in the Americas.
Endemic to (only found in) the United States, the species inhabits slow-moving and still bodies of freshwater in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Alabama.
Unlike most other turtle and tortoise species, the sex of the hatchlings is completely genetic and not affected at all by nest temperature.
The color of individuals ranges from dark olive green to brown. It is the darkest softshell turtle present in Florida. The plastron is usually white.Like all softshell turtles, the Florida softshell turtle’s shell lacks hard, bony scutes, and is soft and leathery to the touch.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They can live up to 100 years.</li>
      <li>Scientific name: Apalone ferox</li>

    <h2>1. GREAT BARRIER REEF SEA SNAKE</h2>
    <p>The Great Barrier Reef sea snake, scientifically known as Pelamis platura, is one of the most fascinating marine reptiles. It is found in the tropical waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. These snakes have a bright yellow and black coloration that helps them blend into coral reef environments. Known for being highly venomous, their venom is used to paralyze prey, such as fish and eels. Despite their potent venom, they are generally not aggressive toward humans. Their elongated bodies and paddle-like tails make them excellent swimmers. Great Barrier Reef sea snakes can hold their breath for long periods, diving to hunt and hiding in reef crevices. They face threats from habitat destruction, overfishing, and climate change.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Venomous, but non-aggressive to humans.</li>
      <li>Can live up to 10 years in the wild.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. SEA KRAIT</h2>
    <p>The sea krait, or Laticauda, is one of the most well-known sea snakes, characterized by its black and white striped body. These snakes are highly venomous and have a potent neurotoxin. They are typically found in the Pacific Ocean, ranging from Southeast Asia to Japan. Sea kraits are amphibious, spending part of their life on land where they lay their eggs and rest. They are skilled hunters and prey on fish, particularly fish eggs. Sea kraits are unique in that they are able to return to land to shed their skin and reproduce, unlike most sea snakes. Their venom helps immobilize prey, which they consume while still underwater.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Highly venomous with a potent neurotoxin.</li>
      <li>Can live on land and water.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. BLACK-BANDED SEA KRAIT</h2>
    <p>The Black-Banded Sea Krait (Laticauda semifasciata) is a highly venomous species found in the Pacific Ocean. Its striking black and white bands make it easily identifiable. This species is typically found in shallow coastal waters and is known to be a proficient hunter. Black-banded sea kraits feed on eels and small fish, using their venomous bite to immobilize their prey. Unlike other sea snakes, these kraits are known to come on land to rest and lay their eggs, a behavior that makes them unique in the sea snake world. Despite their venomous nature, they are rarely dangerous to humans.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Has a neurotoxic venom.</li>
      <li>Spends time both in the water and on land.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. YELLOW-BELLIED SEA SNAKE</h2>
    <p>The Yellow-Bellied Sea Snake (Pelamis platura) is an incredibly venomous species that is found in tropical oceans across the Indian and Pacific Oceans. They are easily recognizable by their bright yellow bellies and sleek, black bodies. These sea snakes spend their entire lives in the water, feeding on small fish and eels. Unlike land snakes, they are entirely adapted to marine life, with a flattened tail that helps them navigate through the water. Despite their venom, yellow-bellied sea snakes are not usually aggressive and pose little threat to humans unless provoked.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Spends entire life in water.</li>
      <li>Has highly toxic venom.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. OLIVE SEA SNAKE</h2>
    <p>The Olive Sea Snake (Aipysurus laevis) is a highly venomous species found in the Indo-Pacific region, including coastal Australia, Southeast Asia, and the Solomon Islands. Its body is olive-colored, which helps it blend with the sandy seafloor and coral reef habitats. Olive sea snakes primarily feed on fish and fish eggs, using their venom to paralyze and immobilize prey. Known for their exceptional swimming skills, they can dive to depths of over 100 meters in search of food. Despite their venomous bite, these snakes are not typically aggressive and avoid human interaction.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Olive-colored body for camouflage.</li>
      <li>Feeds on fish and fish eggs.</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="animal-description">
    <h2>6. HARDHEAD SEA SNAKE</h2>
    <p>The Hardhead Sea Snake (Homalopsis buccata) is a venomous species found in shallow coastal waters of the Indo-Pacific. These snakes are named for their tough, hard heads, which help them protect themselves from predators. They typically hunt small fish and eels, using their venom to paralyze and catch their prey. Known for their distinct appearance with a flattened head, these snakes are proficient swimmers and are often found near reefs and rocky seabeds. Hardhead sea snakes are highly venomous but not typically a threat to humans unless provoked.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Distinct hard head for protection.</li>
      <li>Feeds on fish and eels.</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="animal-description">
    <h2>7. BRIDLED SEA SNAKE</h2>
    <p>The Bridled Sea Snake (Laticauda colubrina) is a species known for its dramatic black and white coloration and unique ability to spend significant time on land. It primarily resides in the Indo-Pacific region, including the Philippines and Indonesia. Bridled sea snakes are capable hunters, feeding on fish and eel species that inhabit shallow waters. They have a venomous bite, but are not typically dangerous to humans unless provoked. Their land-dwelling behavior is one of the reasons they stand out among other marine snakes.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Spends significant time on land and water.</li>
      <li>Highly venomous but not a significant threat to humans.</li>
    </ul>
